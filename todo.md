This sounds like an awesome and ambitious project that can help you dive deep into modern web development! Here’s a high-level roadmap and guidance for each part of your vision:

1. Planning & Design:

	•	Start with a wireframe or mockup using tools like Figma or a simple sketch. This will help you visualize the layout and interactions.
	•	Break down your project into sections: intro, navbar, work, resume, contact, API, and interactions like scroll effects and the CPU/GPU mode toggle.

2. Learning Path:

Frontend (React, HTML, CSS, JS):

	•	React will help you build components like the intro section, navbar, and each content section.
	•	JavaScript for handling the CPU/GPU mode toggle, scroll events, and smooth scrolling navigation.
	•	SCSS or CSS-in-JS (styled-components) for custom animations and styles.

Backend (Node.js, Express):

	•	Use Node.js and Express to create and serve a REST API that you’ll later connect to the Swagger UI section.

3. Implementation Guidance:

Intro Section:

	•	Start by creating a full-screen component (Intro.js).
	•	Learn how to use React state for the CPU/GPU mode toggle.
	•	Practice animations with CSS transitions or libraries like GSAP for text fading effects.

Navbar:

	•	Research sticky navigation and how to detect scroll direction in JavaScript.
	•	Use React Router to manage smooth scrolling to different sections.

Sections & Scrolling:

	•	Explore scroll animations with libraries like Framer Motion or Intersection Observer API.
	•	Plan how assets will move based on scroll position (parallax effects).

Copy-to-Clipboard Button:

	•	Look into the Clipboard API for handling email copying.

REST API & Swagger UI:

	•	Create a simple API with Express and document it using Swagger.
	•	Learn how to embed Swagger UI into a React component.

4. Tools & Resources:

	•	React Documentation: For understanding React’s component system and state management.
	•	MDN Web Docs: For JavaScript, CSS, and HTML basics.
	•	Node.js Documentation: For backend development.
	•	YouTube & Udemy: Great for project-based tutorials.
	•	GitHub: To track your progress and share your code.

5. Next Steps:

	•	Break tasks into sprints. Start with the intro section and navbar. Build, test, and refine.
	•	Focus on one feature at a time. Get the CPU/GPU toggle working before moving to scroll effects.

This project will touch multiple technologies and concepts, giving you a hands-on way to learn. Excited to see what you create—let me know if you want more focused advice on any part!
