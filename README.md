# Personal Portfolio (Vercel)
Hello! Welcome to the repo for my personal portfolio!


I've been using this as a project to showcase my "resume" digitally while also learning fullstack web development.


This branch features my production deployment in [Vercel](https://portfolio-eight-lac-63.vercel.app), showcasing a more advanced design, a REST API, etc.
