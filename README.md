# Personal Portfolio (Github Pages)
Hello! Welcome to the repo for my personal portfolio!


I've been using this as a project to showcase my "resume" digitally while also learning fullstack web development.


This branch features my deployment in [my Github Pages site](https://aksheyd.github.io/), but Github Pages only supports static websites (üò¢). 
To turn that frown upside down, I'm using Vercel to deploy ***[my website](https://portfolio-eight-lac-63.vercel.app) with way more features, better design, and even a REST API for future use.***
Check out the branch [here](https://github.com/aksheyd/Personal-Portfolio/tree/vercel).
